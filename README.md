# PWHL Data Scraper

This project is currently used to read data from the [PWHL's official stats website](lscluster.hockeytech.com),
parse it, and output text in Wikipedia table format.  I use this to update the 2024 team season pages
(e.g., [2024 PWHL Minnesota season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_PWHL_Minnesota_season)).
